## [Breakanoid](/breakanoid/)
![Breakanoid Screenshot](/public/img/breakanoid_small.png){:.right}
Built during a quiet Christmas break in 2018, I created a tiny (and completely unoptimised) game engine in JavaScript as a way to get up to speed with some of the EcmaScript 6 features. 

Rather than the usual contrived 'Hello World' examples, I decided to build a break-out clone: [Breakanoid](/breakanoid)!

## [Estimator](/estimator)
![Estimator Screenshot](/public/img/estimator.png){:.right}
After working in a Web Agency environment for quite a few years I found that, more often than not, estimates for work were required before having the full picture. I prefer a bit more structure than just a finger in the air (or elsewhere) to get to a number so I put together Estimator - a little tool to help derive estimates for projects.

## [3D Engine](/3d/)
![3D Engine Screenshot](/public/img/3d-engine.png){:.right}
_Way back_ in the mid to late nineties, before 3D accelerator cards were even a thing, I used to dabble in 3D graphics inspired by [the Demoscene](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demoscene). Using Borland Turbo Pascal 7 and embedded Assembler, for the bits that just needed pure speed, I built a few simple demos which, sadly, never saw the light of day. 

I decided to see how much I could remember by building a tiny 3D engine from scratch, in JavaScript, without using any 3D libraries - all the maths by hand and nothing more than a 2D canvas.
